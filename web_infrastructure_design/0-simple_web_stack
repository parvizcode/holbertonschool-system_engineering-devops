Explanation
What is a server?
A server is a computer or virtual machine that provides services or resources (like websites, files, or data) to other devices over a network.

What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable name that maps to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8) through the DNS system, so users don’t have to remember numeric IP addresses.

What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
The www is typically an A record that points www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

What is the role of the web server (Nginx)?
The web server handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from users, serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images), and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

What is the role of the application server?
The application server processes dynamic requests, runs the application logic, and interacts with the database when needed.

What is the role of the database (MySQL)?
The database stores, retrieves, and manages data required by the application (e.g., user information, content, transactions).

What is the server using to communicate with the user’s computer?
The server communicates via TCP/IP protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) over the internet.

Issues with This Infrastructure
SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
If the single server goes down, the entire website becomes unavailable.

Downtime during maintenance:
Deploying new code or restarting the web server will cause downtime since there’s no backup server.

Scaling issue:
A single server cannot handle too much incoming traffic. It cannot scale horizontally without additional servers.
